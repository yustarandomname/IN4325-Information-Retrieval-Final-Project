Since PyTerrier itself does not implement any neural rankers, we'll use the [**Fast-Forward indexes** library](https://github.com/mrjleo/fast-forward-indexes), which focuses on efficient re-ranking using neural models and provides PyTerrier integration (using transformers). In order to learn more about Fast-Forward indexes, have a look at the [documentation](https://mrjleo.github.io/fast-forward-indexes/docs/v0.2.0/) and the [corresponding paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485447.3511955).\n"
